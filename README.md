|User can add new animals to the zoo| User fills in the add animal form and clicks the add button | The new animal will be added to the list of all animals and is available for editing or filtering|

## Feature Wishlist

Given more time there's a few things I'd like to add to this app:
* Add the ability to delete animals from the list
* Make a method for entry of baby animals so that a baby could be added to the list and then linked to the mother.
* Better page layout, fixing the forms to not stack on top of each other
